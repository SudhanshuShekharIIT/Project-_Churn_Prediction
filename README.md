# Project-_Churn_Prediction
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning algorithms. Churn prediction is crucial for bank to understand and retain their customers. By analyzing customer data and behavior, we can predict which customers are likely to churn and take proactive measures to prevent it.
<br>
**Algorithms Used**
<br>
Logistic Regression: This algorithm is commonly used for binary classification problems like churn prediction. It models the probability of a customer churning based on the input features.
<br>
Support Vector Classifier (SVC): SVC is a powerful algorithm for classification tasks that works by finding the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space.
<br>
KNeighbors Classifier: KNeighbors Classifier is a simple algorithm that classifies samples based on the majority class among their k nearest neighbors.
<br>
Decision Tree Classifier: Decision Tree Classifier is a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility.
<br>
Random Forest Classifier: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees to improve the predictive performance.
<br>
Gradient Boosting Classifier: Gradient Boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees.
